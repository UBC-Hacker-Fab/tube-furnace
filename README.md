# Tube Furnace

A community-built high-temperature tube furnace for the HackerFab project at UBC, designed for annealing and other thermal processes for micro-fabrication.

## Overview

This tube furnace is a DIY student implementation building off of the HackerFab project. It features a furnace capable of reaching up to 1000C. 

This tube furnace is a DIY implementation suitable for hobbyists, makerspaces, and small-scale labs. It features programmable temperature control, precise heating profiles, and a modular design for easy assembly and modification.

## Features

- **Programmable Control**: Automated PID control and ramp rates
- **High Temperature Capability**: Reaches temperatures up to 1000C


## Future Features

- Customizable heating profiles
- Custom Control electronics
- Data logging capabilities


## Components

- Quartz tube 
- High-temperature heating elements
- COTS temperature controller with PID regulation

## Quick Start

1. **Review Documentation**
   - Check [Assembly.md](SOP/Assembly.md) for detailed build instructions
   - See [Operation.md](SOP/Operation.md) for safety and usage guidelines

2. **Simulation**
   - Use the Simulink models in `Simulations/` to understand thermal dynamics
   - Run `TubeFurnace.m` for MATLAB analysis

3. **Assembly & Testing**
   - Follow the SOP documentation step-by-step
   - Test control systems before high-temperature operation

## Safety

- Always wear appropriate PPE when operating the furnace
- Ensure adequate ventilation
- Use proper grounding and electrical safety measures
- Never leave the furnace unattended during operation
- Refer to detailed safety procedures in [Operation.md](SOP/Operation.md)
