## Assembly Sections

### Section 1: Preparation

**Objective**: Prepare the main quartz tube for heating

**Steps**:

1. **Inspect the quartz tube**
   - Ensure that your quartz tube does not have any existing cracks of defects

2. **Attach horizontal supports**
   - Position two blocks on each side of the quartz tube
   - Insert a long rod into the tube, and tape the ends to the two blocks
   - Ensure that the tube can be spun freely, this will help while applying the furnace cement


**Verification**:
- [ ] Tube is level and can be freely spun
- [ ] Tube is not contacting the table or blocks

### Section 2: Heating Element Installation

**Objective**: Wind and install the heating element around the quartz tube

**Steps**:

1. **Prepare materials**
   - Ensure that you have your kanthal wire on hand
   - Open your furnace cement, and prepare it for use with a paintbrush

2. **Initial cement layer**
   - Coat the section of the quartz tube that you would like a heating element on with furnace cement
   - Slowly spin the tube while painting on cement
   - Ensure that the layer is smooth and uniform, try to avoid air bubbles and clumps

3. **Initial layer bake**
   - Place the tube inside of an oven at 100C for at least 1 hour to dry the first layer of cement
   
4. **Heating element winding**
   - Unwind enough wire to connect to your contorl system and tape the end to the tube
   - From the edge of the cement layer, slowly start winding the kanthal wire around the tube
      - Spacing: approximately 2-5 mm between coils
   - Slowly spin the tube while winding the wire at equal distances apart
   - Once you are done winding, tape the ends of the wire to the tube so that it doesn't unwind
   - **Note:** Try to keep the seperation between windings as small as possible
   - **Warning:** Do NOT let any of the windings touch, as this will short circuit

5. **Second cement layer**
   - Before you start applying cement, ensure that none of the windings are touching and you are satisfied. After this step, you will not be able to change it
   - Similar to step 2, apply another thin layer of cement on top of the windings
   - Keep a consistent thickness, try to avoid bubbles and clumps, and spin the tube to assist in application

6. **Second layer bake**
   - Place the tube inside of an oven at 100C for at least 2 hours to dry the first layer of cement

**Verification**:
- [ ] Cement is fully dried
- [ ] There are no windings that touch
- [ ] There is enough excess kanthal wire to connect to the control system

### Section 3: Insulation Installation

**Objective**: Install and wrap the quartz tube inside of insulation

**Steps**:

1. **Prepare PPE**
   - Ensure that you are wearing gloves and an appropriate mask for this section
   - ⚠️ Insulation can have very fine particles and strands that can be harmful to your respiratory system

2. **Wrap insulation**
   - Place the tube at one end of your insulation, and begin wrapping
   - Ensure that the two heating element ends are NOT wrapped with the tube. These should be wrapping around the insulation, and then pulled out after the first wrap
     - Wrapping the element onto the tube can introduce unwanted heat concentrations that can damage the tube 

3. **Secure insulation**
   - Secure the insulation using two wires on each end

**Verification**:
- [ ] Heating element is NOT wrapped touching the tube, and only taken out after the first insulation layer

## Final Assembly Checklist

- [ ] All structural components are secure
- [ ] Insulation is properly installed
- [ ] Heating element is functional and centered
- [ ] Tube is properly positioned
- [ ] Thermocouple is installed and reads correctly
- [ ] All electrical connections are verified
- [ ] Safety systems are functional
- [ ] No loose parts or tools inside furnace

---

## Testing Before First Use

1. **Electrical safety test**
   - Verify grounding with multimeter
   - Check for shorts or continuity issues

2. **Heating element test**
   - Power on briefly at low power
   - Verify heating element glows uniformly
   - Check for unusual sounds or smells

3. **Temperature controller test**
   - Set target temperature to 100°C
   - Verify controller reaches and maintains temperature
   - Test temperature ramp up and down

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Likely Cause | Solution |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| Temperature reading errors | Thermocouple disconnected | Verify thermocouple connections |
| No power to heating element | Loose connections or relay failure | Check wiring and continuity |
| Cracks forming in quartz tube | Thermal stress or ramp rate too high | Decrease temperature ramp rate |

## Safety Reminders

⚠️ **Always observe:**
- Furnace reaches extremely high temperatures - use heat-resistant gloves
- Never touch any part of the furnace during operation
- Ensure proper ventilation
- Allow cooling time before disassembly
- Review [Operation.md](Operation.md) before first use
