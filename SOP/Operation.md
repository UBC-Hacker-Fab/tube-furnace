## Safety Requirements

### ⚠️ Critical Safety Information

**DO NOT OPERATE** this furnace unless you have:
- [ ] Read and understood this entire operation guide
- [ ] Reviewed all safety warnings
- [ ] Completed assembly verification


### Temperature Hazards

⚠️ **Extreme Temperatures:**
- Operating temperature: Up to 1000°C (1832°F)
- Exterior surfaces can reach ~50°C during operation
- **Cooling time:** Allow at least 1 hour before touching exterior
- Never touch the tube, heating element, or internals while hot

### Electrical Safety

⚠️ **High-Voltage Equipment:**
- Furnace operates on 120 V AC / DC power
- Ensure proper grounding before operation
- Do not operate with wet hands or in wet conditions
- Keep water and liquids away from electrical connections
- Check all wiring for damage before each use

### Confined Space Material Warning

⚠️ **Do not enclose samples with:**
- Plastic bags or containers
- Sealed glass vessels
- Any material that could create dangerous pressure
- Always use open or vented sample holders

## Pre-Operation Checklist

**Perform before EVERY use:**

### Visual Inspection
- [ ] Check for cracks or damage in ceramic components
- [ ] Inspect heating element for visible wear or damage
- [ ] Verify insulation material is intact
- [ ] Check tube for cracks or discoloration
- [ ] Ensure no loose debris inside furnace chamber

### Electrical System Check
- [ ] Verify power cord is undamaged
- [ ] Check all cable connections are secure
- [ ] Verify controller power-on light illuminates

## Startup Procedure

### Step 1: Initial Setup
1. Ensure furnace is powered off
2. Verify all safety checklists are complete
3. Allow furnace to reach room temperature (if previously used)
4. Insert sample into furnace chamber
   - Position sample in center of tube
   - Use appropriate sample holder
   - Ensure sample cannot contact quartz tube

### Step 2: Power On
1. Switch main power to **ON**
2. Verify controller displays room temperature reading
3. Confirm heating element does **NOT** activate

### Step 3: Set Temperature Setpoint

**Manual Temperature Control:**
1. Set desired target temperature using controller interface
2. Click "SET" and input 0001
3. Go to "Pv" and click "SET"
4. Set the desired temperature setpoint
5. Click "SET"
6. Go to "END" and click "SET"

### Step 4: Monitor Initial Heating
- Watch for first few minutes of operation
- Listen for any unusual sounds
- Check for any unusual odors (normal slight smell is acceptable)

## Shutdown Procedure

### Controlled Shutdown

1. **Stop heating:**
   - Follow step 3 in [Startup Procedure](#startup-procedure) to decrease the temperature slowly
   - Decrease the temperature in 100-200C increments in order to ensure slow ramp down

2. **Monitor cooling:**
   - Do NOT attempt to cool rapidly (risk of thermal shock)
   - Allow natural cooling in furnace
   - Monitor temperature decrease on display


### After Shutdown

- [ ] Allow minimum 1 hour before removing samples
- [ ] Wear heat-resistant gloves when removing samples
- [ ] Never place hot samples on combustible surfaces
- [ ] Allow furnace to reach room temperature before next use
